    "Social networks have become a fixture of modern life thanks to social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter. Social networks themselves are not new, however. The study of such networks dates back to the early twentieth century, particularly in the field of sociology and anthropology. It is their prevelance in mainstream applciations that have moved these types of studies to the purview of data science. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basis for the analyses in this notebook comes from Graph Theory- the mathmatical study of the application and properties of graphs, originally motivated by the study of games of chance. Generally speaking, this involves the study of network encoding, and measuring properties of the graph. Graph theory can be traced back to Euler's work on the Konigsberg Bridges problem (1735). However in recent decades, the rise of the social network has influenced the discpline, particularly with Computer Science graph data structures and databases. \n",
    "\n",
    "A Graph, then can be defined as: `G = (V, E)` consiting of a finite set of nodes denoted by `V` or `V(G)` and a collection `E` or `E(G)` of unordered pairs `{u, v}` where `u, v ∈ V`. Less formally, this is a symbolic repreentation of a network and their relationships- a set of linked nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs can be either directed or undirected. Directed graphs simply have ordered relationships, undirected graphs can be seen as bidirectional directed graphs. A directed graph in a social network tends to have directional semantic relationships, e.g. \"friends\" - Abe might be friends with Jane, but Jane might not reciprocate. Undirected social networks have more general semantic relationships, e.g. \"knows\". Any directed graph can easily be converted to the more general undirected graph. In this case, the adjacency matrix becomes symmetric.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few final terms will help us in our discussion. The cardinality of vertices is called the *order* of the Graph, where as the cardinality of the edges is called the *size*. In the above graph, the order is 7 and the size is 10. Two nodes are adjacent if they share an edge, they are also called neighbors and the neighborhood of a vertex is the set of all vertices that a vertex is connected to. The number of nodes in a vertex' neighborhood is that vertex' degree. \n",

    "## Required Python Libraries ##\n",
    "\n",
    "The required external libraries for the tasks in this notebook are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. networkx\n",
    "2. matplotlib\n",
    "3. python-louvain\n",
    "\n",
    "NetworkX is a well maintained Python library for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure of complex networks. Its tools allow for the quick creation of graphs, and the library also contains many common graph algorithms. In particular NetworkX complements Python's scientific computing suite of SciPy/NumPy, Matplotlib, and Graphviz and can handle graphs in memory of 10M's of nodes and 100M's of links. NetworkX should be part of every data scientist's toolkit. \n",
    "\n",
    "NetworkX and Python are the perfect combination to do social network analysis. NetworkX is designed to handle data at scale, data that is relevant to modern scale social networks. The core algorithms that are included are implemented on extremely fast legacy code. Graphs are hugely flexible (nodes can be any hashable type), and there is an extensive set of native IO formats. Finally, with Python- you'll be able to access or use a myriad of data sources from databases to the Internet."
