## Downloading your Data

This code will work with email data; and hopefull you have some to use for
the class. In particular, we will use a common format for email storage
called `mbox` - if you have Apple Mail, Thunderbird or Microsoft Outlook
you should be able to export your `mbox` with a bit of ease. If you have
[Gmail](https://gmail.com), follow these steps to export your mail:

1. Go to [https://www.google.com/settings/datatools](https://www.google.com/settings/datatools).
2. Click on "Create a new archive"
3. Select only Mail to be added to the archive
4. Select your compression format (zip for Windows, tgz for Mac)
5. Once the archive has been created, you will receive an email notifaction

Make sure you do this in advance of the class, it can take hours or even
days for the archive to be created!
